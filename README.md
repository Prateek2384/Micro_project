# Micro Project using JsonPowerDB

Description:
The project is a Student Enrollment Form that leverages JsonPowerDB for backend database operations such as adding, updating, and retrieving student records. The form includes fields like roll number, name, class, birthdate, address, and enrollment date. It dynamically enables/disables the save, update, and reset buttons based on the input values, ensuring a smooth user experience.

JsonPowerDB is chosen for its simplicity, ease of use, and RESTful APIs, making it an ideal choice for lightweight projects requiring fast and efficient database management.
